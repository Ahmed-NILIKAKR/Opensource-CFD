# Mesh Files for Flow Over a Circular Cylinder (Laminar Cases)

This folder contains the **Gmsh geometry (`.geo`) file** and associated mesh data used for simulating **2D flow over a circular cylinder** at laminar Reynolds numbers in OpenFOAM.

The mesh is specifically designed for **Case 1** in the study:
- **Reynolds Number:** 100
- **Free Stream Velocity (U∞):** 0.00604 m/s
- **Cylinder Diameter (D):** 0.25 m
- **Domain Size:** 6 m × 3 m (extruded to 0.05 m in Z for 2D setup)

## 1️⃣ Problem Setup

The geometry represents a **cylinder-in-crossflow** benchmark case with:
- Inlet on the left
- Outlet on the right
- Symmetry boundaries on the top and bottom
- The cylinder wall as a no-slip boundary
- Front and back faces set to `empty` for 2D simulation

**Patch Names:**
| Patch Name | Type      |
|------------|-----------|
| `Inlet`    | patch     |
| `Outlet`   | patch     |
| `Cylinder` | wall      |
| `Top`      | symmetry  |
| `Btm`      | symmetry  |
| `FrtBck`   | empty     |

## 2️⃣ Mesh Generation

The mesh was generated in **Gmsh** with the following specifications:

| Metric                   | Value / Description     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Total Cells**          | 49,342                  |
| **Cell Type**            | Hexahedra only          |
| **Points**               | 99,728                  |
| **Total Faces**          | 197,890                 |
| **Internal Faces**       | 98,162                  |
| **Domain Thickness (Z)** | 0.05 m (2D extrusion)   |
| **Boundary Patches**     | 6                       |

**Mesh Quality:**
- Max Aspect Ratio: **3.99**
- Max Non-Orthogonality: **43.93°** (average: 8.77°)
- Max Skewness: **0.46**
- Min Cell Volume: **5.14 × 10⁻⁷ m³**
- Max Cell Volume: **2.36 × 10⁻⁵ m³**
- SICN: avg **0.6467** (0.1023 min, 0.7462 max) → moderate to good
- SIGE: avg **0.9879** (0.7178 min, 1.0 max) → excellent

## 4️⃣ Purpose & Usage

- This mesh is **tailored for low-Re laminar simulations** using `icoFoam` in OpenFOAM.
- Serves as the **baseline mesh** for validation before running higher-Re cases.
- Designed to balance **mesh quality** and **computational cost** for hardware with limited resources.
