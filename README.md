# 🌀 CFD Simulation of Flow Over a Circular Cylinder using OpenFOAM

This repository contains a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) project focused on simulating the **2D incompressible flow over a circular cylinder** across a range of Reynolds numbers. The entire workflow is developed using **open-source software** and executed on a **personal computing device** (without HPC resources).

## 📌 Objective

- Perform CFD simulations using a complete open-source stack.
- Demonstrate the feasibility of accurate CFD on personal hardware (laptop) without HPC or cloud computing.
- Study laminar to turbulent flow regimes over a canonical geometry (cylinder).
- Use different OpenFOAM solvers for varying flow conditions.
- Validate results against published literature; analyze deviations and their causes.
- Emphasize accessibility, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness in CFD research.

## 📈 Mesh Details 
The Mesh_files directory contains all mesh generation files used in this study. Separate mesh configurations are provided for laminar and turbulent simulations to reflect their distinct resolution requirements.

    Laminar meshes are optimised for low-Reynolds-number cases, balancing cell count and accuracy to capture vortex shedding without unnecessary computational cost.

    Turbulent meshes include finer boundary-layer refinement and extended wake-region resolution to accurately resolve high-Re flow structures.

All meshes were generated using Gmsh for a 2D computational domain (6 m × 3 m) extruded in the spanwise direction for OpenFOAM compatibility. Mesh quality was assessed using SICN and SIGE metrics, ensuring solver stability and physical fidelity across all cases.
